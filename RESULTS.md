# Results

What is measured, how, and what was deleted after measuring it. Every figure here
is reproducible from this branch; v1's numbers live on the
[`v1-incident-agent`](https://github.com/KrasiKirov/freshet/tree/v1-incident-agent)
branch and do not describe this code.

## The one measurement: end-to-end staleness

`make freshness` → `results/freshness.json`

- **t0** = the provider's own `created_at`. This deliberately includes the poll
  wait we do not control, because it is the delay a user experiences. Measuring
  from *fetch* time instead would flatter the number by excluding its dominant
  term.
- **t1** = the moment the update is queryable in pgvector.
- **Comparison arm** = an hourly batch index. Derived, not guessed: uniformly
  arriving events wait `interval/2` on average, so the hourly arm is ~1800s.

**Only live arrivals are scored** — updates posted after indexing began
(`ts >= min(indexed_at)`). This matters more than it sounds. Scored without that
filter over a 24h window, the pipeline reported a mean staleness of **41,995s and
a ratio of 0.06** — streaming apparently *losing* to hourly batch — purely because
three years of backfilled history had all been indexed at once. The filter is what
makes the metric measure pipeline speed rather than when it was switched on.

**Status: not yet measured**, and the eval now says so rather than emitting zeros.

The earlier number here (`n=33`, ratio 0.06 — streaming apparently 14x SLOWER than
hourly batch) was an artifact and has been deleted. Its cause is worth recording:
the filter `ts >= min(indexed_at)` excludes backfilled HISTORY but cannot tell a
slow pipeline from a stopped one. The pipeline had been down ~14 hours; every
update posted during the outage was indexed in the catch-up burst afterwards and
scored as ~9.8 hours of staleness. The measurement was of my own outage.

Uptime is now proven rather than assumed: the embedder writes a heartbeat, and
only the CURRENT unbroken run is scored (a gap over 5 minutes starts a new run).
A restart therefore resets the window instead of charging its backlog to the
pipeline's speed. With no live arrivals yet the report carries `status: not yet
measured` and no ratio at all, and `FRESHNESS_MIN_N` fails the run rather than
reporting a thin sample.

## Measured on the live pipeline

| | |
|---|---|
| providers | 42, each verified robots-allowed and serving entries |
| one sweep | 3,676 updates from 42 feeds in 1.6s |
| warm sweep | 96% fewer updates re-parsed (ETag → 304) |
| dedup | 3,676 → 3,671, matching the 5 duplicate records counted independently |
| observed rate | ~50 updates/day (30-day), ~88/day (7-day) |
| lifecycle | 205 opened / 195 resolved per 400 events — a plausible balance |
| stated causes | 3 of 68 incidents (4%) |

## Things that were built and then deleted

The useful part of this project is what the measurements killed.

**A correlated-degradation detector** (≥3 providers degrading in one 5-minute
event-time window). Measured against 3.1 years of real data it fired **zero
times**; even a 60-minute window fires ~6×/year. 42 providers are too few for
simultaneous degradation. It had been designed to justify using Flink rather than
to serve the objective — the wrong direction of reasoning, and the measurement
made that visible.

**An adversarial root-cause benchmark**, deleted with the v1 agent. Worth
recording why: it was *game-able*. A blind positional rule ("second-to-last
change") scored **1.000 and beat the LLM** while understanding nothing, because
the generator planted every trap at a constant offset. Rebuilding it — randomised
trap counts, a permanent guard scoring blind index rules against an explicit
chance ceiling — was what made its later numbers meaningful.

**Cross-encoder reranking and multi-query expansion.** v1 measured rerank as
neutral at benchmark scale and multi-query at +0.05 while requiring an API key.
Neither justified its cost.

**Recency decay.** Every practical half-life cost recall on retrospective queries,
and the shipped 30-minute default underflowed every score to 0.0 at realistic
event ages — a feature that silently did nothing.

## Honest limits

- **4% of incidents state a cause.** The brief quotes the provider's sentence when
  one exists and stays silent otherwise. Conservative filters reject promised
  RCAs ("a detailed root cause analysis will be shared"), progress announcements
  ("we have identified the root cause and reverted the change"), and ongoing
  investigations — each rule derived from a real false positive, not speculation.
- **The source is polled, not pushed.** Freshness is bounded by the 60s cadence.
- **Briefs are non-deterministic**, since an LLM writes them. Citations are
  verified on both event id and timestamp against the retrieved evidence, so a
  fabricated one is stripped rather than shipped.
- **Delivery is at-least-once.** A failed Slack post now raises: the consumer
  releases its claim and the Kafka offset stays uncommitted, so the brief is
  retried instead of being recorded as delivered. The cost of that choice is the
  opposite failure — a crash after the post but before the database write can
  duplicate an alert. Exactly-once would need an outbox; a duplicate alert is the
  cheaper of the two failures.
